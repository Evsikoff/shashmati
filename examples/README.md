## Web Examples

First, start the included web server by running

```bash
node server.js
```

Then you can go to `http://localhost:9091/demo.html` to see a simple but working example of how to integrate stockfish.js into the frontend with a board. See `loadEngine.js` and `enginegame.js` to learn more.

You can also view `http://localhost:9091/` for a rudimentary example of how to send commands directly to the engine.

## Node.js Examples

There are two Node.js examples included: `node_abstraction.js` and `node_direct.js` which demonstrate how to use the engine on the command line.
